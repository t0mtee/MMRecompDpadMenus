# Majora's Mask: Recompiled D-Pad Menus Mod

This mod allows you to navigate menus using the D-pad. Furthermore, it adds references to the new controls through replacing text.

If I've missed any menus, please let me know by contacting me on Discord (tomtee_) or by opening a GitHub issue.

What is that icon you ask? It's a D-pad in a kaleidoscope. Because this mod lets you use the D-pad in the kaleidoscope. Duh.
